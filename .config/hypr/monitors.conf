# --- Primary Example 1 ---
# Place HDMI-A-1 on the left and DP-1 on the right.
# HDMI-A-1 is positioned at the origin (0,0), and DP-1 is placed to the right at (2560,0).
monitor = HDMI-A-1, preferred, 0x0, 1
monitor = DP-1, preferred, 2560x0, 1


# --- Example 2 ---
# Place DP-1 on the left and HDMI-A-1 on the right.
# DP-1 is positioned at the origin (0,0), and HDMI-A-1 is placed to the right at (2560,0).
# monitor = DP-1, preferred, 0x0,1
# monitor = HDMI-A-1, preferred, -2560x0,1


# --- Example 3 ---
# Place DP-1 on the top and HDMI-A-1 on the bottom, stacking vertically.
# DP-1 is positioned at the origin (0,0), and HDMI-A-1 is placed below at (0,1440) (assuming 1440 is the height of DP-1).
# Note: Adjust the Y coordinate (the fourth value) according to your monitor's resolution for correct vertical stacking.
# monitor = DP-1, preferred, 0x0,1
# monitor = HDMI-A-1, preferred, 0x1440,1
